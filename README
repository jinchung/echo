This project contains a non-blocking TCP Echo Server and its corresponding 
client.  

The TCP Echo Server creates a socket bound to port 1060 of the specified
interface to listen for connection requests. The server accepts each
connection request received which creates a socket for communication between 
itself and the client. While still accepting connection requests, the server
also looks for messages from all connected clients and echoes any received
messages back to the sender.

The TCP Echo Client opens a socket and connects to the server.  It reads lines 
of input from the user, sending each line as a message to the server and waiting
to receive its echo back.  When the user enters a period as the input line, the
client closes the socket and exits.

Invocation:

Server: python server.py [interface]
Client: python client.py host
